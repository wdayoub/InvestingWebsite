            <h2>Why Should You Invest ?</h2>
            <img src="whyinvest.png" alt="why invest" class="left-img">
            <p>before we even talk about investing and all the benefits that it brings to protecting 
                that hard earned money that you have made. I want you to understand the importance of investing so that you are convinced
                that it is a right decision to make as a young adult.
            </p>
            <p>Since you’re reading this I will assume that you know nothing about investing and you want to learn more about it so that you understand
                 what you should do with that next paycheque that you get. Right now you most likely get your paycheck, you pay the bills that you have 
                 to pay every month, then you stash away whatever you have left in a checking or savings account. These accounts are a great way to have
                  instant cash on hand for whenever you need pay for something in the near future. However by keeping all of your money in there,
                   you are losing money every year even if you’re not spending that money. How does that happen you ask ? The answer is inflation my friend. Inflation is the increase of goods and services in the economy. Every year the price of most things increases in value. For example, the groceries that you get every month have increase by 7% in 2023. This means that you now need more of that money you have saved to buy the same items you used to buy last year.
                    When we start putting it in this way and understand how inflation is affecting your saved money, we can start to understand that the value of that capital in that
                     savings account is going down, which essentially means you are losing money without even spending it. Inflation happens for many reasons that you can read about in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/what-causes-inflation-and-does-anyone-gain-it.asp#:~:text=As%20the%20demand%20for%20a,due%20to%20demand%2Dpull%20inflation.">this article</a>. </p>
            <p>The last and final obvious reason to invest is to potentially grow your capital in the future. Investing has made people a lot of money from very little capital. When you start investing in your 20s
                you are potentially giving your future self more money to do the things that you want. You can also give yourself a good retirement when you start early because you are giving that invested money time to 
                compound. Compounding is when the money you gained from investing is being reinvested which can give you even more profits and returns in the market.
            </p>
            <h2>Where Do I Find The Money To Invest ?</h2>
            <p>The biggest question that I get when I tell people to start investing is where do I get the money to invest ? Since I'm assuming that you're in your 20s maybe you don't have a job. Therefore
                start by getting a job anywhere where you can make at least $2,000 a month. Now let's assume that you already have a job but after your expenses you aren't left with much to invest. In this case 
                you need to start budgeting and seeing where your money is going. Are you spending too much on rent? maybe get a roommate. How much is your car costing you. Cars are most of people's biggest purchase. 
            Therefore you need to be careful not to buy a car that's cheap and reliable. If you can't buy a cheap car in cash right now then you're going to pay a lot to finance it since interest rates are through the roof 
                right now.  </p>
                <img src="savingmoney.jpg" alt="why invest" class="right-img" class="img-tilt-hover">
            <p>The next step is to look at your monthly statements and see where your money is going to and what you can cut down on in your day-to-day expenses. Are you buying coffee every day from Starbucks? 
                make your own coffee at home it costs $0.20 cents to make instead of paying $4 for it at Starbucks. If you have a lot of subscriptions like Netflix, Amazon prime, or Hulu, you might want to consider 
                stopping these subscriptions. Alot of the things that you're paying for online can be found for free if you do some research. Are you eating out a lot or getting food delivered often? Consider buying 
                groceries and making your own meals. If you're a student that doesn't have time to cook everyday, then you can meal prep on the weekend and have ready meals to preheat for the rest of the week. That is 
                what I used to do when I was bodybuilding. You might think that doing all of these minor financial changes wont make a difference but you'd be surprised how much money you'll have at the end of the month
                when you watch how your money is being spent.   
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you do everything you can to save money and you still don't have much to invest at the end of the month then your issue is an income issue. 
                The good news is that you are in your 20s and you have a lot of time to build up your income. If you are working a minimum wage job, you need to 
                learn a skill that can get you a better job and increase your income. In my case I decided to learn Computer Science so that I can write code that 
                can get me a better job. I used to work at a home hardware store that gave me $15 per hour then I got a software engineering internship that paid me 
                $70,000 a year as a second year student which gave me a lot of left over money to invest since I was earning a good income. I also kept my expenses low
                by living at home and watching every dollar that was being taken out of my account.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also look into starting a business as a side hustle while working a job. In my case I started a dropshipping website where I found products
                for a cheaper price and sold it for more. I also started a landscaping business in the summer and a snow removal buisness in the winter that made me 
                a good amount of money when I was younger. There are lots of ideas that can start a Successful business so get creative and keep in mind to watch your 
                spending. think of your income as a stream of water and your savings is the bucket, your bucket of water won't be filled if there are holes in the bucket. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>What Should I Invest In ?</h2>
            <p>The question of what should I invest in is somewhat of a mystery that hasn't been figured out. Just like Mathew McConnaughy said in The Wolf of Wall Street "I don't care if you're 
                Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet, nobody knows if the stock market is gonna go up, down, sideways, or in f******* circles". This is why you should take everyone's advice with a grain of salt 
                and do your own research before jumping into any kind of investment. Otherwise you'll let your losses teach you a lesson, and we don't want that. I would say the biggest advice is to keep up with 
                the news. It will keep you informed of what is happening in the overall economy, some new acomplishments of the top companies, and it keeps you up to date.</p>
